# app-design — Design & Build Applications

Design a complete application — from idea to production code in the target platform. No HTML prototypes. Build directly in React, Angular, Vue, Blazor, or any framework.

## The Process

```
Stage 1: UNDERSTAND  →  Stage 2: PLAN  →  Stage 3: DESIGN  →  Stage 4: BUILD
(Requirements)          (Architecture)     (Design System)     (Production Code)
```

**⚠️ ONE STAGE AT A TIME.** Complete one stage, show the output, and STOP. Wait for the user to review and approve before moving to the next stage. Do NOT chain stages autonomously.

After completing a stage, tell the user what was done and what comes next:
```
✅ Stage [N] complete: [what was created]
→ Next: Stage [N+1] — [description]. Ready to proceed?
```

**Resume from where you left off.** Check what artifacts exist:
- OpenSpec change with proposal → start at Stage 2
- `APP_ARCHITECTURE.md` exists → start at Stage 3
- `DESIGN.md` exists → start at Stage 4
- Source files exist → go to iteration

## Brownfield Projects (Existing Codebase)

If the project already has source code, screens, or components:

1. **Analyze first** — before planning or building, read the existing codebase to understand:
   - Folder structure and file naming conventions
   - Component library in use (Syncfusion, Material UI, Ant Design, custom, etc.)
   - State management pattern (Redux, Zustand, NgRx, Vuex, etc.)
   - Routing setup and navigation pattern
   - Existing CSS approach (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components, SCSS, etc.)
   - Test framework and patterns

2. **Extract design** — if no `DESIGN.md` exists but the project has established styles, use the `design-system` skill to extract tokens from existing CSS/components into `DESIGN.md`.

3. **Match patterns** — all new code MUST follow the existing project's conventions. Do not introduce new patterns, libraries, or folder structures unless the user explicitly asks.

4. **Map existing screens** — if adding to an existing app, create `APP_ARCHITECTURE.md` that documents both existing screens AND planned additions.

---

## Stage 1 — Understand

Gather requirements through conversation. Ask **one or two questions at a time**:

1. **What are you building?** — App type and one-line description
2. **Core features?** — 3–7 key things the app needs to do
3. **Who are the users?** — Target audience, roles, technical level
4. **What platform/framework?** — React, Angular, Vue, Blazor, etc.
5. **What's the mood/style?** — Professional, playful, minimal, bold, luxury, technical
6. **Any apps you like the look of?** — Visual references
7. **Existing brand?** — Colors, fonts, logo already decided?
8. **Dark mode needed?**

### Output

**⚠️ MANDATORY:** Create the OpenSpec change via `openspec-propose` with the gathered requirements. This produces `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` in the change folder. Do NOT skip this step — do not jump to design or build without a proposal.

**✅ STOP HERE.** Show the proposal summary and wait:
```
✅ Stage 1 complete: OpenSpec change created with proposal, specs, and tasks.
→ Next: Stage 2 — Plan screen architecture. Ready to proceed?
```

---

## Stage 2 — Plan (Screen Architecture)

Plan every screen, navigation, and key user journeys.

### Screen Types

| Type | Description | Typical Components |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `dashboard` | Overview with stats | KPI cards, charts, activity feed |
| `list` | Collection with search/filter | DataGrid, filter bar, pagination |
| `detail` | Single item view | Tabs, content sections, side panel |
| `form` | Create or edit | Form inputs, validation, submit |
| `kanban` | Columns with cards | Kanban board, drag-and-drop |
| `calendar` | Date-based view | Scheduler, event details |
| `settings` | Configuration | Tabs, form sections, toggles |
| `auth` | Login/signup | Centered card, form |
| `chat` | Messaging | Conversation list, message thread |

### Navigation Patterns

| App Type | Navigation |
|----------|-----------|
| SaaS / Dashboard / Admin | Sidebar (collapsible) + Top bar |
| Mobile app | Bottom tab bar (4–5 tabs) |
| Simple tool | Minimal top bar |
| E-commerce | Top nav + category sidebar |

### Output

Create `APP_ARCHITECTURE.md` in the project with:
- Navigation pattern and items
- Screen inventory table (name, type, priority, description)
- Key user journeys (screen → screen → screen)
- Priority: P0 (core, 4–8 screens), P1 (important, 3–6), P2 (nice-to-have)

**✅ STOP HERE.** Show the architecture summary and wait:
```
✅ Stage 2 complete: APP_ARCHITECTURE.md created with [N] screens ([N] P0, [N] P1, [N] P2).
→ Next: Stage 3 — Create design system (DESIGN.md + tokens.css). Ready to proceed?
```

---

## Stage 3 — Design (Design System)

Activate the `design-system` skill. It creates `DESIGN.md` + `tokens.css`.

The design system must be approved before any code is written.

**✅ STOP HERE.** Show the design summary and wait:
```
✅ Stage 3 complete: DESIGN.md + tokens.css created.
→ Next: Stage 4 — Build production code. Ready to proceed?
```

---

## Stage 4 — Build (Production Code)

Build screens directly in the target framework. No HTML prototypes.

**⚠️ Before writing any code:** Output the pre-flight checklist from `workflow-rules.instructions.md`. Confirm all checks pass.

**Engineering gates still apply:** TDD (Gate 4), incremental slices (Gate 5), code review (Gate 6), and atomic commits (Gate 7) from the `software-dev-workflow` skill are enforced during build.

### Step 1 — Detect stack and check Syncfusion skills

Check `package.json` or `*.csproj` for the framework. If Syncfusion component skills are installed, use them. If not, suggest installation:

```
npx skills add syncfusion/<framework>-ui-components-skills -y
```

### Step 2 — Configure theming

**⚠️ MANDATORY:** After confirming the framework, consult the matching Syncfusion themes skill for detailed implementation guidance:

| Framework | Themes Skill |
|-----------|-------------|
| React | `syncfusion-react-themes` |
| Angular | `syncfusion-angular-themes` |
| Vue | `syncfusion-vue-themes` |
| Blazor | `syncfusion-blazor-themes` |
| JavaScript | `syncfusion-javascript-themes` |
| ASP.NET Core | `syncfusion-aspnetcore-theme` |
| WPF | `syncfusion-wpf-theming` |
| WinForms | `syncfusion-winforms-theming` |
| .NET MAUI | `syncfusion-maui-theming` |

The themes skill provides:
- How to integrate `tokens.css` with Syncfusion's theming system for that framework
- Correct CSS variable mapping between design tokens and Syncfusion theme variables
- Theme registration and configuration specific to the framework

Do not skip this step — incorrect theming leads to visual inconsistencies between custom UI and Syncfusion components.

### Step 3 — Map screens to components

For each screen in the architecture, map UI elements to Syncfusion components:

| Screen Element | Syncfusion Component |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Data table | DataGrid |
| Charts/graphs | Charts, AccumulationChart |
| Calendar/schedule | Scheduler |
| Kanban board | Kanban |
| Form inputs | TextBox, NumericTextBox, DropDownList |
| Date picker | DatePicker, DateTimePicker |
| Sidebar nav | Sidebar |
| Tabs | Tab |
| Modal/dialog | Dialog |
| Toast/notification | Toast |
| Rich text | RichTextEditor |
| File upload | Uploader |
| Tree navigation | TreeView |
| Dashboard layout | DashboardLayout |

### Step 4 — Build in priority order

Build P0 screens first, then P1, then P2. For each screen:

1. Create the component/page in the framework's conventions
2. Use `tokens.css` variables for all styling — no hardcoded values
3. Use Syncfusion component skills for correct API usage, imports, and setup
4. Include realistic sample data — never Lorem ipsum
5. Wire up navigation between screens

### Step 5 — Icon system

Choose one icon library for the project and use it consistently. Do NOT mix libraries or default to emoji.

| Library | Install | Framework Usage |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `lucide` | `npm i lucide-react` / `lucide-vue-next` / `lucide-angular` | `<Home size={20} />` (React) |
| `phosphor` | `npm i @phosphor-icons/react` / `vue` / `web` | `<House size={20} />` (React) |
| `tabler` | `npm i @tabler/icons-react` / `vue` / `angular` | `<IconHome size={20} />` (React) |
| `material` | `npm i @mui/icons-material` (React) / `@angular/material` | `<HomeOutlined />` (React) |
| `bootstrap` | `npm i react-bootstrap-icons` / `bootstrap-icons` | `<House size={20} />` (React) |
| `heroicons` | `npm i @heroicons/react` / `vue` | `<HomeIcon className="w-5 h-5" />` (React) |

**Rules:**
- Ask the user which icon library to use during Stage 1 (or detect from existing project)
- Install the framework-native package — not CDN links
- Use **only** the selected library — do not mix
- Use icons for: nav items, buttons, stat cards, empty states, action menus
- For Blazor/WPF/WinForms/MAUI — use the framework's built-in icon system or Syncfusion icons

### Step 6 — Preview

Start the dev server and open in the integrated browser to verify.

## Iteration

| User wants | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| Change a color/font | Update `DESIGN.md` → re-export `tokens.css` (components auto-update via CSS variables) |
| Change a screen's content | Edit that component only |
| Add a new screen | Generate component + add route/nav item + update architecture |
| Change navigation | Update layout component + routing |
| Swap a component | Read the new Syncfusion component skill, replace in the screen |
