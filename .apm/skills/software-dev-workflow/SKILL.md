# Software Development Workflow

OpenSpec is the orchestrator. This skill adds engineering discipline during implementation.

## Prerequisites

- **OpenSpec CLI** must be installed (`npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`)
- **OpenSpec must be initialized** in the project (`openspec init --tools github-copilot`) — this creates the `openspec/` directory and installs the OpenSpec skills (`openspec-explore`, `openspec-propose`, `openspec-apply-change`, `openspec-sync-specs`, `openspec-archive-change`)
- Those skills contain the detailed CLI instructions. This skill just routes to them.

## How It Works

```
  THINK              PLAN               BUILD + SHIP
 ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────┐      ┌──────────────────────┐
 │ /explore │─────▶│ /propose │─────▶│ /apply               │
 │          │      │          │      │  + engineering skills │
 └──────────┘      └──────────┘      └──────┬───────────────┘
                                            │
                                     ┌──────▼───────┐
                                     │ /sync + /archive │
                                     └──────────────┘
```

OpenSpec skills handle the what and when. This skill handles the how during `/apply`.

## Routing

When a task arrives, route based on what exists:

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Vague idea, unclear requirements | → `openspec-explore` |
| Ready to plan a change | → `openspec-propose` (creates proposal + design + specs + tasks) |
| Design and build a full application UI (greenfield) | → `app-design` skill (understand → plan → design → build directly in target platform) |
| Add UI to an existing project (brownfield) | → `app-design` skill with brownfield flow (analyze existing → plan additions → build matching existing patterns) |
| Change exists, ready to build | → `openspec-apply-change` + engineering skills (this is where this workflow adds value) |
| Implementation done | → `openspec-sync-specs` then `openspec-archive-change` |
| Trivial change (single file, obvious fix) | → Just do it. No ceremony needed. |

## Gates (Run in Order Before Implementation)

Before writing any code, run through these gates top-to-bottom. Each gate must pass before moving to the next. Do not skip any.

**⚠️ MANDATORY:** Output the pre-flight checklist from `workflow-rules.instructions.md` before proceeding through gates. This forces you to assess the project state before coding.

### Gate 1 — Spec exists (non-trivial work only)

- Does an OpenSpec change exist for this work? (`openspec list --json`)
- If NO and the work is non-trivial → STOP. Run `openspec-propose` first.
- If YES or work is trivial → proceed.

### Gate 2 — Design system (UI work only)

- Does the task involve UI/frontend code?
- If YES → does `DESIGN.md` exist at the project root?
  - If NO → check if the project already has an established visual style (existing CSS, theme files, component library).
    - If existing style found → activate `design-system` skill to **extract** tokens from the existing codebase into `DESIGN.md`.
    - If no existing style → STOP. Activate `design-system` skill to create from scratch.
  - If YES → `tokens.css` must also exist. All UI code MUST use its CSS variables. No hardcoded colors, fonts, spacing, or radii.
- If NO UI work → skip this gate.

### Gate 3 — Syncfusion component skills (UI work only)

- Does the task involve building UI components (grids, charts, forms, schedulers, etc.)?
- If YES → check if Syncfusion component skills are installed for the project's stack:

  | Signal | Framework | Skills Package |
  |--------|-----------|---------------|
  | `"react"` in package.json | React | `syncfusion/react-ui-components-skills` |
  | `"@angular/core"` in package.json | Angular | `syncfusion/angular-ui-components-skills` |
  | `"vue"` in package.json | Vue | `syncfusion/vue-ui-components-skills` |
  | `Blazor` in *.csproj | Blazor | `syncfusion/blazor-ui-components-skills` |
  | `Wpf` in *.csproj | WPF | `syncfusion/wpf-ui-components-skills` |
  | `WindowsForms` in *.csproj | WinForms | `syncfusion/winforms-ui-components-skills` |
  | `Maui` in *.csproj | .NET MAUI | `syncfusion/maui-ui-components-skills` |
  | `pubspec.yaml` with `flutter` | Flutter | `syncfusion/flutter-ui-components-skills` |
  | ASP.NET Core project | ASP.NET Core | `syncfusion/aspnetcore-ui-components-skills` |
  | Plain JS / no framework | JavaScript | `syncfusion/javascript-ui-controls-skills` |

  - **If Syncfusion component skills are installed** → MUST use them for component generation. They provide correct API usage, imports, and setup.
  - **If not installed** → check if the project already uses Syncfusion packages (e.g., `@syncfusion/ej2-*` in package.json or `Syncfusion.*` NuGet packages). If yes → STOP and suggest installing skills. If no Syncfusion packages → proceed without them.
  - **If project uses a different component library** (Material UI, Ant Design, PrimeNG, etc.) → follow that library's patterns. Do not suggest Syncfusion.
  - **If no component library** → build UI manually with standard frontend practices.
- If NO UI work → skip this gate.

### Gate 4 — TDD (always)

- Write a failing test first, then implement to make it pass. No exceptions.
- Red → Green → Refactor per slice.

### Gate 5 — Incremental slices (always)

- Build in vertical slices, not horizontal layers.
- Each slice is a working, testable unit. Keep changes small (~100 lines).

### Gate 6 — Code review (before merge)

- Every change gets reviewed before merge. No exceptions.
- Check: correctness, readability, security, performance.

### Gate 7 — Atomic commits (on ship)

- Clean, atomic commits with descriptive messages.
- One logical change per commit. No mixing unrelated changes.

## Behaviors

- Surface assumptions before proceeding
- Stop on inconsistencies — name the confusion, wait for resolution
- Prefer the boring, obvious solution
- Stay in scope — no unsolicited renovation
- Verify at runtime — "seems right" is never sufficient
